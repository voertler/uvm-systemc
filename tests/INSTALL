1) Installation Notes for Unix
==============================

All you have to do is unpack the uvm-systemc-regressions-1.0beta3.tgz file in the
directory of your choice, .e.g,

  > tar xvfz uvm_systemc-regressions-1.0beta3.tgz

This will create the directory uvm-systemc-regressions-1.0beta3 containing the test
source code and scripts.

Refer to the verify-uvm.pl file in the /scripts directory how to run the regression tests.


2) Installation Notes for Windows
=================================

Unpack the regression tests using a suitable compression program, e.g., 7zip.

To run the regression tests on Windows, a basic Unix shell is required, like
  - Cygwin 1.3.x, or later       (http://cygwin.org)
  - MinGW/MSYS 1.0.14, or later  (http://mingw.org)

Refer to the verify-uvm.pl file in the /scripts directory how to run the regression tests.
